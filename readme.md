## Package Description

The primary goal of this package is for candidates to write code that successfully passes all the provided tests. This exercise is designed to evaluate a candidate's problem-solving skills, coding proficiency, and ability to work with test-driven development practices.

Key points:
- The package contains a set of tests to guide development.
- Candidates are encouraged to implement solutions, even if they don't pass all tests initially.
- The focus is on demonstrating problem-solving skills and coding approach.
- We value seeing your thought process and partial solutions, especially for challenging tests.

To get started, review the test files and implement the required functionality in the corresponding source files. If you are unfamiliar with test driven development, please read the instructions in the `instructions.md` file. 

## Instructions

>This package was created with Node v20.18.0. We recommend using the same version.

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npm test` to run all the tests.

if you want to run a single test, you can run `npm test -- <filename>.test.jsx` from the root of the project.

## Notes

- The tests are written using Jest and React Testing Library.
- the recommended order of implementation is:
    - Counter component
    - useForm hook
    - TaskManager component
